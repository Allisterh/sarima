12/10/2018: Changes in branch 'jamie' from commit b8f0fff

./R/fit.R
   - Notes made with tag (11/10/18) on certain TODOs in sarima.env().
   - Checks added for some environment functions.
   - Removal of duplicated su()

./R/periodogramRecommendations.R
    - is a function for plotting and returning key lags in periodogram

./data/
    - a subset of electricity data added to package to make example easier to run
    
./R/data-electricity.R
    - description of electricity data
    
03/09/2018: Changes in branch 'jamie' from version 0.7-8

./R/fit.R
    sarima_KalmanLike()
        - Line 722 output component 'CSS' changed to 'css'
    sarima_KalmanRun() 
        - Line 741 output component 'CSS' changed to 'css'

    sarimat()
        update_params()
	    - Lines 919-925 asymmetry added to streamlined 'use.symm' method
        .nonstationaryEdit()
             - Lines 1250-1311 asymmetry options included in function
	- Line 1525 switch option 'CSS' changed to 'css'
	- Line 1547 in lik.method = "css" changed to lik.method = "sarima" at end of
	    css option to avoid duplicating code in the later switch() function.
        - Line 1671 css option removed from switch() - duplicate code.


24/08/2018: Changes in branch 'jamie' from version 0.7-8

./R/fit.R
    sarimat()
        - use.symm option incorporated into fitting procedure, which takes advantage 
            of symmetry in the unit root polynomial
        - Lines 881, 917-929 option added for symmetric approach in updateParams()
        - Lines 977-978, 995-996, 1014-1015, 1033-1036, 1057-1060 in each of the 
            optimisation functions, have the option for a symmetric approach in 
            updateParams()
        - Lines 1247-1293 make additions in udelta environment for a symmetric 
            approach
        - Line 1324 update symmetric parcors as well as 'normal' ones
        - Lines 1322-1376 alternative approach to building vectors 
            flags.atanh_sarima, Par_sarima, and fixed needed for 
            symmetric/non-symmetric methods
        - Lines 1449-1463 par.skeleton has different "udelta" component for the 
            two cases
        - Lines 1468-1550 for each method, symmetric option available through 
            use.symm
        - Lines 1803-1841 making Jacobians of different lengths for 
            symm/non-symm methods
        - Lines 1863-1897 if symmetric method is used, we have fewer estimated 
            parameters than polynomial parameters: so expand the variance matrix 
            to match the number of original parameters

./tests/testthat/test-CSS.R
    - Lines 86-106 commented out to reduce test time
    
./tests/testthat/test-symm.R
    - New file added to test that the symmetric approach gives the same answers 
        as the non-symmetric version
